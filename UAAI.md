## 🔥 Quick Insights
Instant opportunity callouts & urgent actions.

### Wallet-Share & Service Gaps
- **Returns & Exchanges** under-penetrated vs eCom scale (peak months Oct–Dec). *Mock penetration: 35% of DTC* → **Target: 70%**.  
- **Parcel Insurance** not bundled on most EU/APAC DTC lanes while **claims trend up** into Q4 → cross-sell **UPS Capital InsureShield®**.  
- **Air Gating for Launches**: Seasonality + Curry/Halo drops → sporadic AIR usage; **standardize a “Launch Playbook.”**  
- **EU Hub Orchestration** (TR/EG/VN → NL) active but **no unified SLA/visibility** across 3PL mix → upsell **SCS Control Tower + Trade Management**.  
- **Address/Returns Friction**: Address corrections & porch-loss pockets in US Sunbelt; **offer Address Validation API + Delivery Defense™**.

### Urgent Actions (next 30 days)
- **Pilot “Insure-at-Cart”** on US DTC for high-ASP footwear; **goal**: insure ≥60% of orders in Nov–Dec.  
- **Enable consolidated drop-off returns** ahead of holiday; **goal**: NPS +5, refunds <3 days.  
- **Stand up Launch Air Gating template** (VN/CN → US-SE DC) for next drop; lock capacity and ETAs 21 days prior.

### Week-over-Week Signals (from provided series)
- **Insured packages** climb **Jan 180 → Dec 590**; **claims** also rise (12 → 92).  
- **Quarterly parcel mix** peaks in **Apr–Jun** & **Oct–Dec**; 2-day share expands in launches → **formalize air-gating.**

## 🧠 Executive Analysis
Comprehensive assessment across network, channels, and risk.

### Executive Summary
UA’s network spans **VN/JO/CN/KH/ID/MY/EG/TR/MX** inbound to **US/EU** with **US outbound** to NA/EU/CA. DTC is structurally high-margin; leadership emphasis on **full-price sell-through** and **lower promos**. Restructuring (incl. **Rialto DC exit by Mar 2026**) suggests a push for **fewer, better nodes** and **service consistency**. Up-sell clusters: **launch orchestration**, **EU control-tower visibility**, **returns modernization**, **risk transfer (insurance)**.

### Key Findings
1) **Launch cadence ≠ standard SOP** → expedited costs + variability; formal air-gating unlocks predictable cycle times.  
2) **Claims rising into Q4** while insured penetration lags → **Capital** cross-sell lowers volatility and CX pain.  
3) **EU Hub (NL) strong**, but multi-origin mix lacks unified **SLA/PO-to-Door visibility** → **SCS Tower** fit.  
4) **Address & last-mile friction** pockets → **Validation API + Delivery Defense™** bundle.  
5) **Tariff/nearshore watch (VN→US exposure)** → **Trade Management** modeling + **MX nearshore pilots** align with lanes (MX→US TRK).

### Opportunities vs Risks
**Opportunities**
- Holiday **returns & exchanges** program (DTC).  
- **Insurance** bundling on high-ASP items (Curry/Halo).  
- **EU orchestration & duty optimization**.  
- **Launch Air Gating** templated SOP.

**Risks**
- Promo pullback may compress DTC volume in shoulder weeks.  
- Tariff shocks (VN) or port congestion → need buffer stock / alt gateways.  
- Change fatigue post-restructure; design **low-lift pilots**.

### Trend Commentary
- **Q2 & Q4 volume peaks** suggest **two annual playbooks**: *Spring/Summer* and *Holiday*.  
- Claims slope is **non-linear** (sharp Q4), implying both **higher exposure** and **customer sensitivity** → strong case for **Capital + Returns**.
